# hello-world
Phobrain is a photo-pair instantiation of a life form creation experiment. 

I call the pairs 'Rorschach pairs' because an individual's labeling of enough of them, given the variety of considerations in weighing each pair, creates a new possibility of detailed modeling of the mind. The sense of how paradigm-significant this might be is currently approximated by using neural nets to project preferences by ranking unlabeled pairs of photos, producing 'interesting' pairs as a result. The 'interesting' space for me comprises 10-12% of randomly-selected pairs from my portrait and landscape photo collections (~10K, 20K photos currently; ~10% contributed), and the next job is to create a life form to navigate that space dynamically and with sufficient sympathy for the user that vertebrate-level love is imaginable. The current placeholder for life is a whimsical pastiche based ad auctions for space on web pages you load, but instead of using commercial cookie data, I use a dance-inspired interpretation of mouse movements to sculpture the probabilites projected by the neural nets. An early image was of skipping a stone on a still pool of mind in a forest, in that there is determinism that might be learnable in an unconscious, ouija-meets-modern-novel way.

Here is the current 'being':

Here is an ongoing attempt to stay in touch with the working world:

My plan is to open-source all the tools for anyone to install, add photos and start marking pairs Y/N to generate their own mind print at the current level, and seeing how spooky it is, join me in changing the common paradigm of material growth that evolution gave us for a not-yet-full planet.

The initial phase will be some general-purpose Java utilities.
